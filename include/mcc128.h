/**
*   @brief Start a hardware-paced analog input scan.
*
*   The scan runs as a separate thread from the user's code.  The function will
*   allocate a scan buffer and read data from the device into that buffer.  The
*   user reads the data from this buffer and the scan status using the
*   mcc128_a_in_scan_read() function. mcc128_a_in_scan_stop() is used to stop a
*   continuous scan, or to stop a finite scan before it completes.  The user
*   must call mcc128_a_in_scan_cleanup() after the scan has finished and all
*   desired data has been read; this frees all resources from the scan and
*   allows additional scans to be performed.
*
*   The scan state has defined terminology:
*   - \b Active: mcc128_a_in_scan_start() has been called and the device may be
*       acquiring data or finished with the acquisition. The scan has not been
*       cleaned up by calling mcc128_a_in_scan_cleanup(), so another scan may
*       not be started.
*   - \b Running: The scan is active and the device is still acquiring data.
*       Certain functions like mcc128_a_in_read() will return an error because
*       the device is busy.
*
*   The valid options are:
*       - [OPTS_NOSCALEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOSCALEDATA): Returns ADC code (a value
*           between 0 and 65535) rather than voltage.
*       - [OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA): Return data without
*           the calibration factors applied.
*       - [OPTS_EXTCLOCK](@ref OPTS_EXTCLOCK): Use an external 3.3V or 5V logic
*           signal at the CLK input as the scan clock. Multiple devices can be
*           synchronized by connecting the CLK pins together and using this
*           option on all but one device so they will be clocked by the
*           single device using its internal clock. \b sample_rate_per_channel
*           is only used for buffer sizing.
*       - [OPTS_EXTTRIGGER](@ref OPTS_EXTTRIGGER): Hold off the scan (after
*           calling mcc128_a_in_scan_start()) until the trigger condition is
*           met.  The trigger is a 3.3V or 5V logic signal applied to the TRIG
*           pin.
*       - [OPTS_CONTINUOUS](@ref OPTS_CONTINUOUS): Scans continuously until
*           stopped by the user by calling mcc128_a_in_scan_stop() and writes
*           data to a circular buffer. The data must be read before being
*           overwritten to avoid a buffer overrun error. \b samples_per_channel
*           is only used for buffer sizing.
*
*   The options parameter is set to 0 or [OPTS_DEFAULT](@ref OPTS_DEFAULT) for
*   default operation, which is scaled and calibrated data, internal scan clock,
*   no trigger, and finite operation.
*
*   Multiple options may be specified by ORing the flags. For instance,
*   specifying [OPTS_NOSCALEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOSCALEDATA) |
*   [OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA) will return the values
*   read from the ADC without calibration or converting to voltage.
*
*   The buffer size will be allocated as follows:
*
*   \b Finite mode: Total number of samples in the scan
*
*   \b Continuous mode (buffer size is per channel): Either
*   \b samples_per_channel or the value in the following table, whichever is
*   greater
*
*   Sample Rate       | Buffer Size (per channel)
*   ----------------- | -------------------------
*   Not specified     | 10 kS
*   0-100 S/s         | 1 kS
*   100-10k S/s       | 10 kS
*   10k-100k S/s      | 100 kS
*
*   Specifying a very large value for \b samples_per_channel could use too much
*   of the Raspberry Pi memory. If the memory allocation fails, the function
*   will return [RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL](@ref RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL). The
*   allocation could succeed, but the lack of free memory could cause other
*   problems in the Raspberry Pi. If you need to acquire a high number of
*   samples then it is better to run the scan in continuous mode and stop it
*   when you have acquired the desired amount of data.  If a scan is already
*   active this function will return [RESULT_BUSY](@ref RESULT_BUSY).
*
*   @param address  The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
*   @param channel_mask  A bit mask of the channels to be scanned. Set each bit
*       to enable the associated channel (0x01 - 0xFF.)
*   @param samples_per_channel  The number of samples to acquire for each
*       channel in the scan (finite mode), or can be used to set a larger scan
*       buffer size than the default value (continuous mode.)
*   @param sample_rate_per_channel   The sampling rate in samples per second per
*       channel, max 100,000. When using an external sample clock set this value
*       to the maximum expected rate of the clock.
*   @param options  The options bitmask.
