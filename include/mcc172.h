*
*   - [SOURCE_LOCAL](@ref SOURCE_LOCAL): The clock is generated on this MCC
*     172 and not shared with other MCC 172s.

*
*   The ADCs will be synchronized so they sample the inputs at the same time.
*   This requires 128 clock cycles before the first sample is available. When
*   using a master - slave clock configuration for multiple MCC 172s there are
*   additional considerations:
*
*   - There should be only one master device; otherwise, you will be
*     connecting multiple outputs together and could damage a device.
*   - Configure the clock on the slave device(s) first, master last. The
*     synchronization will occur when the master clock is configured, causing
*     the ADCs on all the devices to be in sync.
*   - If you change the clock configuration on one device after configuring
*     the master, then the data will no longer be in sync.  The devices cannot
*     detect this and will still report that they are synchronized.  Always
*     write the clock configuration to all devices when modifying the
*     configuration.
*   - Slave devices must have a master clock source or scans will never
*     complete.
*   - A trigger must be used for the data streams from all devices to start on
*     the same sample.
*
*   The MCC 172 can generate an ADC sampling clock equal to 51.2 kHz divided by
*   an integer between 1 and 256. The data_rate_per_channel will be internally
*   converted to the nearest valid rate. The actual rate can be read back
*   using mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read(). When used in slave clock
*   configuration, the device will measure the frequency of the incoming master
*   clock after the synchronization period is complete. Calling
*   mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read() after this will return the measured data
*   rate.
*
*   @param address  The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.

*   The analog input scan may be configured to start saving the acquired data

*   - [TRIG_FALLING_EDGE](@ref TRIG_FALLING_EDGE): Start the scan on a falling

*     high.
*   - [TRIG_ACTIVE_LOW](@ref TRIG_ACTIVE_LOW): Start the scan any time TRIG is

*   using a trigger - there will be approximately 39 samples prior to the
*   trigger event in the captured data.
*
*   Care must be taken when using master / slave triggering; the input trigger

/**
*   @brief Start capturing analog input data from the specified channels
*
*   The scan runs as a separate thread from the user's code.  The function will
*   allocate a scan buffer and read data from the device into that buffer.  The
*   user reads the data from this buffer and the scan status using the
*   mcc172_a_in_scan_read() function. mcc172_a_in_scan_stop() is used to stop a
*   continuous scan, or to stop a finite scan before it completes.  The user
*   must call mcc172_a_in_scan_cleanup() after the scan has finished and all
*   desired data has been read; this frees all resources from the scan and
*   allows additional scans to be performed.
*
*   The scan cannot be started until the ADCs are synchronized, so this function
*   will not return until that has completed. It is best to wait for sync using
*   mcc172_a_in_clock_config_read() before starting the scan.
*
*   The scan state has defined terminology:
*   - \b Active: mcc172_a_in_scan_start() has been called and the device may be
*       acquiring data or finished with the acquisition. The scan has not been
*       cleaned up by calling mcc172_a_in_scan_cleanup(), so another scan may
*       not be started.
*   - \b Running: The scan is active and the device is still acquiring data.
*       Certain functions will return an error because the device is busy.
*
*   The valid options are:
*       - [OPTS_NOSCALEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOSCALEDATA): Returns ADC code (a value
*           between AI_MIN_CODE and AI_MAX_CODE) rather than voltage.
*       - [OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA): Return data without
*           the calibration factors applied.
*       - [OPTS_EXTTRIGGER](@ref OPTS_EXTTRIGGER): Hold off the scan (after
*           calling mcc172_a_in_scan_start()) until the trigger condition is
*           met.
*       - [OPTS_CONTINUOUS](@ref OPTS_CONTINUOUS): Scans continuously until
*           stopped by the user by calling mcc172_a_in_scan_stop() and writes
*           data to a circular buffer. The data must be read before being
*           overwritten to avoid a buffer overrun error. \b samples_per_channel
*           is only used for buffer sizing.
*
*   The [OPTS_EXTCLOCK](@ref OPTS_EXTCLOCK) option is not supported for this
*   device and will return an error.
*
*   The options parameter is set to 0 or [OPTS_DEFAULT](@ref OPTS_DEFAULT) for
*   default operation, which is scaled and calibrated data, no trigger, and
*   finite operation.
*
*   Multiple options may be specified by ORing the flags. For instance,
*   specifying [OPTS_NOSCALEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOSCALEDATA) |
*   [OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA](@ref OPTS_NOCALIBRATEDATA) will return the values
*   read from the ADC without calibration or converting to voltage.
*
*   The buffer size will be allocated as follows:
*
*   \b Finite mode: Total number of samples in the scan
*
*   \b Continuous mode (buffer size is per channel): Either
*   \b samples_per_channel or the value in the following table, whichever is
*   greater
*
*   Sample Rate            | Buffer Size (per channel)
*   ---------------------- | -------------------------
*   200-1024 S/s           |     1 kS
*   1280-10.24 kS/s        |    10 kS
*   12.8, 25.6, 51.2 kS/s  |   100 kS
*
*   Specifying a very large value for \b samples_per_channel could use too much
*   of the Raspberry Pi memory. If the memory allocation fails, the function
*   will return [RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL](@ref RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL). The
*   allocation could succeed, but the lack of free memory could cause other
*   problems in the Raspberry Pi. If you need to acquire a high number of
*   samples then it is better to run the scan in continuous mode and stop it
*   when you have acquired the desired amount of data.  If a scan is already
*   active this function will return [RESULT_BUSY](@ref RESULT_BUSY).
*
*   @param address  The board address (0 - 7). Board must already be opened.
*   @param channel_mask  A bit mask of the channels to be scanned. Set each bit

*   @param samples_per_channel  The number of samples to acquire for each

*       - [STATUS_HW_OVERRUN](@ref STATUS_HW_OVERRUN): The device scan buffer
*           was not read fast enough and data was lost.
*       - [STATUS_BUFFER_OVERRUN](@ref STATUS_BUFFER_OVERRUN): The thread scan
*           buffer was not read by the user fast enough and data was lost.
*       - [STATUS_TRIGGERED](@ref STATUS_TRIGGERED): The trigger conditions have
*           been met.
*       - [STATUS_RUNNING](@ref STATUS_RUNNING): The scan is running.
*   @param samples_per_channel  The number of samples per channel to read.
*       Specify \b -1 to read all available samples in the scan thread buffer,
*       ignoring \b timeout. If \b buffer does not contain enough space then the
*       function will read as many samples per channel as will fit in \b buffer.
*   @param timeout  The amount of time in seconds to wait for the samples to be
*       read. Specify a negative number to wait indefinitely or \b 0 to return
*       immediately with whatever samples are available (up to the value of
*       \b samples_per_channel or \b buffer_size_samples.)
*   @param buffer   The user data buffer that receives the samples.
*   @param buffer_size_samples  The size of the buffer in samples. Each sample
*       is a \b double.
*   @param samples_read_per_channel Returns the actual number of samples read
*       from each channel.
*   @return [Result code](@ref ResultCode),
*       [RESULT_SUCCESS](@ref RESULT_SUCCESS) if successful,
*       [RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL](@ref RESULT_RESOURCE_UNAVAIL) if a scan is not
*           active.
