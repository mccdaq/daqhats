/**
*   Return a list of detected DAQ HAT boards.
*
*   It creates the list from the DAQ HAT EEPROM files that are currently on the
*   system. In the case of a single DAQ HAT at address 0 this information is
*   automatically provided by the OS. However, when you have a stack of
*   multiple boards you must extract the EEPROM images using the
*   \b daqhats_read_eeproms tool.
*
*   Example usage:
*   @code
*       int count = hat_list(HAT_ID_ANY, NULL);

*       if (count > 0)
*       {
*           struct HatInfo* list = (struct HatInfo*)malloc(count * 
*               sizeof(struct HatInfo));
*           hat_list(HAT_ID_ANY, list);
*
*           // perform actions with list
*
*           free(list);
*       }
*   @endcode
*
*   @param filter_id  An optional [ID](@ref HatIDs) filter to only return boards
*       with a specific ID. Use [HAT_ID_ANY](@ref HAT_ID_ANY) to return all
*       boards.
*   @param list    A pointer to a user-allocated array of struct HatInfo. The 
*       function will fill the structures with information about the detected 
*       boards. You may have an array of the maximum number of boards
*       ([MAX_NUMBER_HATS](@ref MAX_NUMBER_HATS)) or call this function while
*       passing NULL for list, which will return the count of boards found, then
*       allocate the correct amount of memory and call this function again with
*       a valid pointer.
*   @return The number of boards found.

*   Enable an interrupt callback function.

*   Set a function that will be called when a DAQ HAT interrupt occurs. The 
*   function must have a void return type and void * argument, such as:
*
*       void function(void* user_data)
*
*   The function will be called when the DAQ HAT interrupt signal becomes
*   active, and cannot be called again until the interrupt signal becomes
*   inactive. Active sources become inactive when manually cleared (such as
*   reading the digital I/O inputs or clearing the interrupt enable.) If not
*   latched, an active source also becomes inactive when the value returns to
*   the original value (the value at the source before the interrupt was
*   generated.)
*
*   The user_data argument can be used for passing a reference to anything 
*   needed by the callback function. It will be passed to the callback function
*   when the interrupt occurs. Set it to NULL if not needed.

*   There may only be one callback function at a time; if you call this
*   when a function is already set as the callback function then it will be
*   replaced with the new function and the old function will no longer be called
*   if an interrupt occurs.
*
*   The callback function may be disabled with hat_interrupt_callback_disable().
*
*   This function only applies when using devices that can generate an
*   interrupt:
*       - MCC 152
*
*   @param function     The callback function.
*   @param user_data    The data to pass to the callback function.
